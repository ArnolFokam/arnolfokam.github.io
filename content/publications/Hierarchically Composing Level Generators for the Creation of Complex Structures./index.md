##### Abstract

Procedural content generation (PCG) is a growing
field, with numerous applications in the video game industry and
great potential to help create better games at a fraction of the cost
of manual creation. However, much of the work in PCG is focused
on generating relatively straightforward levels in simple games,
as it is challenging to design an optimisable objective function
for complex settings. This limits the applicability of PCG to more
complex and modern titles, hindering its adoption in industry.
Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing a compositional level generation method that recursively composes simple
low-level generators to construct large and complex creations.
This approach allows for easily-optimisable objectives and the
ability to design a complex structure in an interpretable way by
referencing lower-level components. We empirically demonstrate
that our method outperforms a non-compositional baseline by
more accurately satisfying a designer’s functional requirements
in several tasks. Finally, we provide a qualitative showcase (in
Minecraft) illustrating the large and complex, but still coherent,
structures that were generated using simple base generators.
